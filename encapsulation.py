# Adding a double underscore makes the attribute a private attribute.
# Private attributes are those which are accessible only inside the class.
# This method of restricting access to our data is called encapsulation.
# When we put a double underscore in front of the attribute name,
# python will internally change its name to _Classname__attribute.
# This is why we get an error when we try to access a private attribute.
